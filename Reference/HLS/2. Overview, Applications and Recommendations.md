**1. Introduction to High-Level Synthesis (HLS)**

*   **Overview**: High-level synthesis (HLS) is a process that transforms a high-level design description, typically in C/C++, into a register-transfer level (RTL) implementation suitable for hardware. [cite: 4] This allows you to design hardware without needing to write RTL code directly, which can be faster and more efficient.
